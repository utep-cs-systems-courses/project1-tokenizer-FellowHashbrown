Project 1: Tokenizer
====================

## How it Works

When starting up the tokenizer (by doing `./tokenizer`), a message appears
telling you exactly what you can do with it. The base command delimiter is
`!`.

### Entering Text

You can just enter in any string of text (limit of 200 characters) and the
tokenizer will remember that for you.

### Entering Commands

There are 2 simple commands.
 * `!q` will quit the tokenizer and empty out the history of text that was entered.
 * `!n` (where `n` is a number) will show you that number entry that you
 entered. If none was found, a simple message of `Not Found` will be
 displayed.
